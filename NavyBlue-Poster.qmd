# Introduction

This visualization shows how transportation habits of employed residents have changed over the decade. This shows how the residernts’ choices of transportation has changed as the public transportation infrastructure evolves over the years.

Strength: The visualization uses the bar chart format, which is clear and easy to read.

Weakness: While different shades of blue are used to differentiate the years, it may be difficult for the color blind to distinguish between the datasets. Some categories are too specific while others are more vague. This makes it difficult to interpret the data

Given persistent skepticism in some communities about the efficacy of
vaccines, it is important to communicate the impact of vaccination on
public health. In this project, we built on a visualization of the
measles incidence in the USA published by the Wall Street Journal[^3]
(@fig-wsj-on-poster). This visualization has garnered praise as "One of
the more compelling data visualizations produced in recent years"[^4].
However, we contend that, despite its effectiveness in summarizing data,
several aspects of the plot can be improved.

# Strengths

-   The heatmap design effectively conveys a high information content
    without cluttering the plot.
-   Pointing with the mouse at a tile opens an infotip, enabling readers
    to retrieve specific incidence data for a given state and year
    (@fig-infotip_color_change). The infotip only occludes a small
    portion of the plot, and the partial transparency of the infotip
    ensures visibility of the tiles underneath.
-   The vertical line indicating the year of vaccine introduction
    provides valuable contextual information.

```

# Suggested Improvements

1.  *Add a plot title and a source note* so that the figure can be
    understood in isolation (e.g., when shared on social media).
2.  *Identify missing data clearly.* Rendering unknown incidence fully
    transparent will distinguish it from zero incidence,
3.  *Include labels for every state.* To avoid overplotting, use
    two-letter abbreviations instead of full state names and stagger the
    labels along the y-axis.
4.  *Add a title to the color legend.*
5.  *Avoid using a rainbow color palette.* It lacks a meaningful
    progression through color space and is not colorblind-friendly.
    Consider using a sequential ColorBrewer palette instead.[^5]
6.  *Use a discrete color palette.* Continuous palettes can make it
    challenging for humans to detect patterns below just noticeable
    color differences.
7.  *Apply a logarithmic color scale* because most data are below the
    mean incidence.
8.  *Add grid lines* in ten-year intervals along the x-axis and for
    every second state along the y-axis. Grid lines will aid in
    identifying states and years in the middle of the plot, even without
    the infotip.
9.  Because there are more missing data on the right side of the plot,
    *shifting y-axis labels to the right* will improve visually matching
    states with corresponding grid lines.

# Implementation

## Data

-   Weekly counts of measles cases by state were obtained from Project
    Tycho.[^6] The data have missing weeks, which were treated as zero
    in @fig-wsj-on-poster, potentially underestimating the annual total.
    Instead, we calculated the weekly mean case count on the basis of
    non-missing data only.
-   Decennial U.S. census data for each state.[^7]

## Software

We used the Quarto publication framework and the R programming language,
along with the following third-party packages:

-   *readxl* for data import
-   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for
    visualization based on the grammar of graphics
-   *knitr* for dynamic document generation
-   *zoo* for interpolating annual population data from the decennial
    U.S. census

# Improved Visualization



# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

Because our visualization was intended for a poster, we did not
implement any interactive features, including the infotip. However, if
the data are visualized in an HTML document, interactive features can be
achieved using the R packages such as *plotly*. In that case, we
recommend that the tile does not change its fill color. In contrast, the
original visualization changes the fill color of the activated tile to
light blue (see @fig-infotip_color_change), which can be misinterpreted
as a change in incidence. Instead, we suggest highlighting the activated
tile by thickening its border.

# Conclusion

We successfully implemented all suggested improvements for the
non-interactive visualization. By labeling every state and choosing a
colorblind-friendly palette, the revised plot is more accessible. The
logarithmic color scale makes the decrease in incidence after the
introduction of the vaccine less striking but enables readers to detect
patterns in the low-incidence range more easily.
