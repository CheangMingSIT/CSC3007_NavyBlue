# Introduction

This visualization shows how transportation habits of employed residents have changed over the decade. This shows how the residents’ choices of transportation has changed as the public transportation infrastructure evolves over the years.




# Previous Visualization

```{r}
#| label: fig-wsj-on-poster
#| out-width: 100%

include_graphics("images/transport_graph.png")
```

# Strengths and weakness

-   Strength: The visualization uses the bar chart format, which is clear and easy to read.

-   Weakness: While different shades of blue are used to differentiate the years, it may be difficult for the color blind to distinguish between the datasets. Some categories are too specific while others are more vague. This makes it difficult to interpret the data


```{r}
#| label: fig-infotip_color_change
#| fig-cap: "Zoomed-in screenshot of the original plot with and without
#|   activated infotip."
#| out-width: 100%

#include_graphics("images/infotip_color_change.png")
```

# Suggested Improvements
1. *Use sparkline* to show the change over the years.

2. *Include a column* for percentage increase or decrease.

3. *Use color* to show the percentage increase or decrease.

4. *Group the data* into public, private and others respectively.

# Implementation

## Data

-   Data was collected from 2000 to 2020 at 5-Year intervals from the Department of Statistics Singapore.[^6] Some data were omitted and combined during the cleaning process.The data includes rows that are not present in the entire dataset for certain years. Therefore, rows that are not in common throughout the dataset were removed.

## Software

The Quarto publication framework and the R programming language were used,
along with the following third-party packages:

-   *readxl* for data import
-   *tidyverse* for data transformation, including *ggplot2* for
    visualization based on the grammar of graphics
-   *knitr* for dynamic document generation
-   *zoo* for interpolating annual population data from the decennial
    U.S. census

# Improved Visualization



# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

Because our visualization was intended for a poster, we did not
implement any interactive features, including the infotip. However, if
the data are visualized in an HTML document, interactive features can be
achieved using the R packages such as *plotly*. In that case, we
recommend that the tile does not change its fill color. In contrast, the
original visualization changes the fill color of the activated tile to
light blue (see @fig-infotip_color_change), which can be misinterpreted
as a change in incidence. Instead, we suggest highlighting the activated
tile by thickening its border.

# Conclusion

We successfully implemented all suggested improvements for the
non-interactive visualization. By labeling every state and choosing a
colorblind-friendly palette, the revised plot is more accessible. The
logarithmic color scale makes the decrease in incidence after the
introduction of the vaccine less striking but enables readers to detect
patterns in the low-incidence range more easily.
