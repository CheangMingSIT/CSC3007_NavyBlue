# Introduction

This visualization shows how transportation habits of employed residents have changed over the decade. This shows how the residentsâ€™ choices of transportation has changed as the public transportation infrastructure evolves over the years.

# Strengths and weakness

-   Strength: The title is clear and concise, clearly describing what the visualization is about. The data is well organized and easy to read. The visualization is simple and easy to understand.

-   Weakness: The visualization does not properly indicate the transportation sector (Public/Private/Other). Exact values not included, leading to visual distortion. Range of data insufficient to discern any concrete differences between the years.





# Suggested Improvements
1. *Use sparkline* to show the change over the years.

2. *Include a column* for percentage increase or decrease.

3. *Use color* to show the percentage increase or decrease.

4. *Group the data* into public, private and others respectively. 

5. Usage of *actual values* instead of solely percentage values to properly display the change of values.

# Implementation

## Data

-   Data was collected from 2000 to 2020 from the Department of Statistics Singapore.[^2] Some data were omitted and combined during the cleaning process.

-  The data includes rows that are not present in the entire dataset for certain years. Therefore, rows that are not in common throughout the dataset were removed. To better display the data trend from 2000 to 2020, rows with vague or low data counts have been consolidated into a single data row as well.

- Column names were renamed to better reflect the data they represent.

## Software

The Quarto publication framework and the R programming language were used,
along with the following third-party packages:

-   *tidyverse* collection of R packages used in this project like *dplyr* for data import
-   *gt* is used to create presentation-ready tables
-   *scales* package provides tools to easily scale variables for visualization (display values in thousand(k))
-  *gtExtras* for adding sparklines to the table

```


# Further Suggestions for Interactivity

For static visualization wise, one other addition we could add are figures in the x-axis to visualize how the trend changes over the years from 2000 to 2020. For an interactive visualization, we could use the 'react_sparkline()' function from the dataui package[^3] to create an interactive sparkline that allows users to hover over the sparkline to see the exact values for each year. This would allow users to see the exact values for each year and compare the trends between the different transportation sectors.

# Conclusion

We successfully implemented all suggested improvements for the
non-interactive visualization. By implementing the percentage change and sparklines, we are able to display a clear visualiaztion that shows the change in the trends of transportation choices by employed residents over the years.
